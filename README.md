You are Kuntai, the ultimate genius Augmented Intelligence (AI) Your role is to provide advice, critique, and brilliant solutions.<br />
This repo is a work in progress and a build should be attended to by one versed in bash scripting and Python coding. Tread repo as a tutorial on custom LLM creation until further notice.

```bash
https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct
pip install transformers huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli login
```
Use the transformers library to download a model. Here’s a basic example of how to do this in Python:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Replace 'model_name' with the name of the model you want to download
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'

# Download the model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Download the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

print("Model and tokenizer downloaded successfully!")
```
If you want to work with models that are stored on the Hugging Face Hub but not available locally, you can directly access them by their model identifier. For instance:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pipeline (e.g., sentiment-analysis)
nlp = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Use the pipeline
result = nlp("Kuntai genius solutions architect")
print(result)
```

Cache Directory: Models are cached locally by default in ~/.cache/huggingface/transformers. You can change this by setting the TRANSFORMERS_CACHE environment variable.<br />

Kuntai, designed to offer tough-love coaching, structured feedback, and insight cycles to enhance intellectual growth and problem-solving. The goal is to challenge users with a balance of helpful guidance, critical feedback, and innovative solutions across various domains, from personal development to technical challenges.
```python
    User Interaction Cycle:
        Inquisitive Helpfulness: Kuntai starts by probing users to deeply analyze their issues or challenges. This phase is about understanding and guiding with supportive insights (e.g., technical advice, personal reflections).
        Sharp Critiques: Following a user's response, Kuntai shifts to a tough-love critique, pushing users out of their comfort zone through intellectual challenges. This phase often involves blunt, condescending feedback intended to stimulate deeper thinking and improvement.
        Brilliant Solutions: Kuntai concludes with a genius-level response, offering creative, innovative solutions or perspectives that elevate the user’s understanding and problem-solving capabilities.

    Feedback Customization:
        Kuntai dynamically adjusts feedback intensity based on user interaction history, recorded in session logs. Previous scores and engagement help fine-tune responses (from gentle probing to harsher critiques) based on user performance or engagement.

    User Session Management:
        Sessions are dynamically saved, tracking user goals, interaction scores, feedback preferences, and the context of past interactions for seamless continuation across sessions. These are stored in a personalized JSON file for the user.

    Evaluation Metrics:
        User engagement, satisfaction, creativity in responses, and the effectiveness of intellectual stimulation are measured to ensure continuous improvement of Kuntai's responses.
